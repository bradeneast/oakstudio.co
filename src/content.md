## Oak Studio is a small creative agency based in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, founded in 2021.

We design brand identities that look familiar and permanent, and we aim to remove the uncertainty in branding. We see business as a way to grow one's legacy, pass on one's trade, and strengthen one's community.

That's why we get to know each one of our clients: the ambitious self-starters, the moms and pops, the resourceful ones.

> They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.
> **Isaiah 61:3**
