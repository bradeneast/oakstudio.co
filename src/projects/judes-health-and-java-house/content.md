Jude’s Health & Java House is a coffee shop and natural health store in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. The goal was to solidify the connections Jude’s was already making with Bartlesville locals and expand that same familiarity into surrounding areas.

Because Jude’s was an established local business that stood on consistency, familiar faces, and outstanding quality, there was huge potential to be unlocked from further developing their brand.

With the 15th anniversary of Jude's coming up, we suggested creating patterns for use on special edition merchandise. Each pattern was based on the logo in a unique way.

## Branded apparel was also an important part of the rebrand, for both customers and employees.

## Packaging
Because Jude's offers a variety of coffee and supplements, among many other things, there was a significant amount of packaging design involved. Aligning these packaging designs with the overall brand identity presented an acute challenge. They had to strike a perfect balance between premium and accessible.

## Advertising
Finally, to help extend the brand reach into neighboring communities, we applied the identity to the Jude's website and an eye-catching billboard.

## Outcomes
This conceptual rebrand was a special opportunity for Jude’s to resonate even more deeply with the health-conscious and java-loving Bartlesville locals, and stand out as a natural, premium, and accessible personality for an audience that cares about themselves and their environment.
