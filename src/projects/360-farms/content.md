360 Farms is the only business that makes start-to-finish elderberry products for people seeking value and quality. The goal was to reinforce their brand with those wanting improved health and well-being in an era of McDonaldâ€™s and WalMart.

The demand for elderberry products had increased in recent years, and 360 Farms' core demographic was shifting. They felt their brand was not striking a chord with customers.

## For 360 Farms, family was an extremely important brand attribute.
The land on which the farm operated had been kept in the family since 1947. This made it important to start from a place of heritage and belonging.

## We worked with 360 Farms to develop a system of colors, fonts, and logo formats that made the brand fluid and durable.
From elderflower soaps to elderberry wines, 360 Farms produces and sells it all. Because of this wide range of products, they had great need for a versatile logo that would work in any context.
