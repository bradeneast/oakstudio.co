The target market for East Texas Elderberries is families or businesses that want to create their own syrup or elderberry products. They sell elderberries in a frozen or dehydrated form and wanted a brand that could scale rapidly with production.

## East Texas Elderberries expressed that they never wanted to lose sight of their orientation toward *family*.
As we discovered more about this elderberry farm, it became clear that family and generational legacy were the heartbeat of the operation. That gave us a starting point, from which we looked to design something timeless, approachable, and durable.

## From billboards to browsers
This identity needed to adapt fluidly for every application. To solve this, we designed logo alternates, which would work at different scales: from as large as a billboard design to as small as a browser favicon.

## Speaking of web browsing...
East Texas Elderberries wanted a way to reinforce their brand while interacting online. To help with that, we designed a set of icons to supplement content on their website. These icons were a great visual aid to catch and hold attention of potential customers.
