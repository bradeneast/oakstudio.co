### Our Vision

We want to see people and organizations in the midwest become more localized, familiar, and familial.

While others come and go, some brands will outlast the rest because their roots go deep. Our approach is to strengthen those roots instead of tossing them out. To that end, we think memorable, durable design is paramount.
