Oak Studio was created out of a desire to do something permanent.

We come from backgrounds in graphic design, web development, marketing, photography, and illustration. We started noticing an increase in **transience** among people and businesses. We didn't like that, so we looked for a place to put down our roots, and help the community around us thrive and grow in **permanence**.

In essence, we're making our area into a strong hill to defend.
