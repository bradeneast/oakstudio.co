Oak Studio was created out of a desire to do something long-lasting.

We come from backgrounds in graphic design, web development, marketing, photography, and illustration. We started noticing an increase in **transience** among people and businesses. We didn't like that, so we looked for a place to put down our roots, and help the community around us thrive in place.
