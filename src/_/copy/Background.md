### Our Background

Oak Studio was created out of a desire to do something long-lasting.

We come from backgrounds in graphic design, web development, marketing, photography, and illustration. Recently we've noticed a lot of **transience** - people and businesses not sticking around long enough to make a dent. In response, we looked for a place to put down our roots, and help our community contributors have staying power.
