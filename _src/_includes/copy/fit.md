> Have you been noticing a race to rebrand lately, and wonder if you should be doing the same thing? Would it be a waste of time and money? Worse yet, would upset your customers?

We have the same concerns. In fact, we'd rather you *not work with us* if your business has other priorities right now.

That said, many issues in **sales**, trouble **generating leads**, and **keeping loyal returning customers** can actually be symptoms of mis-aligned branding. We want to help you discover if that's the case!

- Your business might be attracting a certain type of customer, but you're not sure why.
- You might be sporadically generating leads, but inconsistently and unpredictably.
- Maybe your business often has customers that return once or twice, only to disappear off the map.
