The demand for elderberry products had increased in recent years, and 360 Farms'
core demographic was shifting. They felt their brand was not striking a chord
with customers.

From elderflower soaps to elderberry wines, 360 Farms produces and sells it all.
Because of this wide range of products, they had great need for a versatile logo
that would work in any context. Family was an extremely important brand
attribute, and the land on which the farm operated had been kept in the family
since 1947. This made it important to start from a place of _heritage_ and
_belonging_.

We sat down with the owners and let them describe the customer base that 360
Farms currently had, as well as their goals for reaching a new demographic. In
the end, we discovered two core customer archetypes to help ensure that the
brand would resonate with 360 Farms' entire audience.

From there, we worked with 360 Farms to develop a system of colors, fonts, and
logo formats that made the brand fluid and durable.

Since refreshing their brand, 360 Farms is helping even more high-quality people
live high-quality lives through the power of elderberry products.
