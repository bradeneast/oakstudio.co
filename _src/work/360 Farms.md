## Situation Appraisal

The demand for elderberry products had increased in recent years, and 360 Farms' core demographic was shifting. They felt their brand was not striking a chord with customers.

From elderflower soaps to elderberry wines, 360 Farms produces and sells it all. Because of this wide range of products, they had great need for a versatile logo that would work in any context.

## Customer Profiles

Before designing their identity, we studied customer archetypes to help 360 Farms be as relevant as possible to their purveyors. We discovered two core customer profiles to help ensure that the brand would resonate with as much of 360 Farms audience as possible.

## Brand Attributes

For 360 Farms, family was an extremely important brand attribute. The land on which the farm operated had been kept in the family since 1947. This made it important to start from a place of heritage and belonging.

> We worked with 360 Farms to develop a system of colors, fonts, and logo formats that made the brand fluid and durable.
