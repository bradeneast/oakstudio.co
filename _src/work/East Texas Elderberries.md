The target market for East Texas Elderberries is families or businesses that
want to create their own syrup or elderberry products. They sell elderberries in
a frozen or dehydrated form and wanted a brand that could scale rapidly with
production.

East Texas Elderberries expressed that they never wanted to lose sight of their
orientation toward _family_. As we discovered more about this elderberry farm,
it became clear that family and generational legacy were the heartbeat of the
operation. That gave us a starting point, from which we looked to design
something timeless, approachable, and durable.

This identity needed to adapt fluidly for every application. To solve this, we
designed logo alternates, which would work at different scales: from as large as
a billboard design to as small as a browser favicon.

East Texas Elderberries wanted a way to reinforce their brand while interacting
online. To help with that, we designed a set of icons to supplement content on
their website. These icons were a great visual aid to catch and hold attention
of potential customers.

In the end, we helped East Texas Elderberries establish a brand identity that
works in every area they needed. They are a family business that is
well-equipped to look attractive and trustworthy for many generations to come.
