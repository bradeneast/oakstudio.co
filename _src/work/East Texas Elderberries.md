## Goals

The target market for East Texas Elderberries is families or businesses that want to create their own syrup or elderberry products. They sell elderberries in a frozen or dehydrated form and wanted a brand that could scale rapidly with production.

## Brand Attributes

East Texas Elderberries expressed that they never wanted to lose sight of their orientation toward *family*. As we discovered more about this elderberry farm, it became clear that family and generational legacy were the heartbeat of the operation. That gave us a starting point, from which we looked to design something timeless, approachable, and durable.

> &ldquo;We had a wonderful experience with the team. The outstanding quality and the attention to detail was beyond compare. I highly recommend their services.&rdquo;

## Logo variants

This identity needed to adapt fluidly for every application. To solve this, we designed logo alternates, which would work at different scales: from as large as a billboard design to as small as a browser favicon.

## Iconography

East Texas Elderberries wanted a way to reinforce their brand while interacting online. To help with that, we designed a set of icons to supplement content on their website. These icons were a great visual aid to catch and hold attention of potential customers.

## Outcomes

In the end, we helped East Texas Elderberries establish a brand identity that works in every area they needed. They are a family business that is well-equipped to look attractive and trustworthy for many generations to come.
