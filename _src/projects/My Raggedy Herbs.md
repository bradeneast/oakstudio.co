description: My Raggedy Herbs is a gardening and homemaking education brand for moms, grandmoms, and the herbally inclined. These folks expect regular educational content on herbs, cooking, crafts, and more. The face of My Raggedy Herbs has always been Raggedy Ann, but never had a digital representation to accompany their iconic photo. With this new logo, the brand showed that even online, on printed materials, and in the hands of their audience, Raggedy never fails to disappoint.
