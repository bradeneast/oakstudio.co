## For 360 Farms, family was an extremely important brand attribute.

The land on which the farm operated had been kept in the family since 1947. This made it important to start from a place of heritage and belonging.

## We worked with 360 Farms to develop a system of colors, fonts, and logo formats that made the brand fluid and durable.

From elderflower soaps to elderberry wines, 360 Farms produces and sells it all. Because of this wide range of products, they had great need for a versatile logo that would work in any context.
