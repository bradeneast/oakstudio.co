## Goals

The target market for East Texas Elderberries is families or businesses that want to create their own syrup or elderberry products. They sell elderberries in a frozen or dehydrated form and wanted a brand that could scale rapidly with production.

## East Texas Elderberries expressed that they never wanted to lose sight of their orientation toward *family*.

As we discovered more about this elderberry farm, it became clear that family and generational legacy were the heartbeat of the operation. That gave us a starting point, from which we looked to design something timeless, approachable, and durable.

## From billboards to browsers

This identity needed to adapt fluidly for every application. To solve this, we designed logo alternates, which would work at different scales: from as large as a billboard design to as small as a browser favicon.

## Speaking of web browsing...

East Texas Elderberries wanted a way to reinforce their brand while interacting online. To help with that, we designed a set of icons to supplement content on their website. These icons were a great visual aid to catch and hold attention of potential customers.

{% for scheme in ["light", "dark"] -%}
<section class="carousel-wrapper bleed {{ scheme }}">
	<div class="carousel" data-dots="false" data-scrollTime="2000">
		{%- for i in range(1, 11) -%}
		<img class="carousel__item" style="max-width: 12rem;" src="/img/east-texas-elderberries-icon-example-{{ i }}-{{ scheme }}.png" alt="" />
		{%- endfor -%}
	</div>
</section>
{%- endfor %}

## Social media was an important place for East Texas Elderberries to put their best foot forward.

On-brand ads were a must-have for catching the eyes of their target market. So, we got to work.
