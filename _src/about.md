Oak Studio is a small creative agency based in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.

We see our work as a way to **create permanence** in a time when it seems like nothing sticks around. We think family-minded businesses are the best way to pass on trades, strengthen communities, and preserve legacies. Most importantly, we think like our clients: the ambitious self-starters, the future &ldquo;moms and pops&rdquo;, the resourceful ones.

Oak Studio was created out of a desire to do something long-lasting.

We come from backgrounds in graphic design, web development, marketing, photography, and illustration. Recently we've noticed a lot of transience - people and businesses not sticking around long enough to make a dent.

In response, we looked for a place to put down our roots, and help our community contributors have staying power.

We want to see people and organizations in the midwest become more localized, familiar, and familial.

While others come and go, some brands will outlast the rest because their roots go deep. Our approach is to strengthen those roots instead of tossing them out. To that end, we think memorable, durable design is paramount.
