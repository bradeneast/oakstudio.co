> Have you been noticing a race to rebrand lately, and wonder if you should be doing the same thing? Would it be a waste of time and money? Worse yet, would upset your customers?

We have the same concerns. In fact, we'd rather you *not work with us* if your business has other priorities right now.

That said, many issues in **sales**, trouble **generating leads**, and **keeping loyal returning customers** can actually be symptoms of mis-aligned branding. We want to help you discover if that's the case!

- Your business might be attracting a certain type of customer, but you're not sure why.
- You might be sporadically generating leads, but inconsistently and unpredictably.
- Maybe your business often has customers that return once or twice, only to disappear off the map.

## Hold your horses.

We want our projects to be highly personalized. If you want to work with an agency at arms length, we might not be a good fit.

We want to empower businesses that will keep the ball rolling, pay it forward, and put down roots. If that doesn't sound like you, we'll politely pass.

We'd like to make something that will last for generations, not follow trends. If you want something with an expiration date, then [don't contact us here](/contact).
