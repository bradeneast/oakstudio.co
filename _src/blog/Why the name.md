## The Mingo

In 1931 the [Mingo Oak](http://www.nativetreesociety.org/historic/mingo_oak.htm) was discovered to be nearly 600 years old. Despite its age, this distinguished West Virginia resident was expected to continue its life indefinitely. Just 7 years later, the great tree died from the smoke and aerosolized byproduct of a nearby coal mine.

Like the Mingo Oak, when we think of things that are strong, resiliant, and have widespread roots, oaks are the first trees come to mind. That's a metaphor we resonate with. We see a way to do build brands like that - nurturing the stories and ideas that help businesses stick around, put down roots, and resist the waves of trend.

## The Jurupa

Perhaps even more amazing than the Mingo Oak, the [Jurupa Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurupa_Oak) is a clonal colony of oak trees that's estimated to be thousands of years old. The Jurupa Oak is technically a single organism, each visible tree sharing the same root system.

That's a second layer to the metaphor. We're invested in the idea of small communities with rich economies that are built on family values. Working with like-minded people is what we do.
