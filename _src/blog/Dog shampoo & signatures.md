If you've ever owned a poodle, you know that they're a lot of work, but extremely smart and very fun to have around. We have to bathe and groom ours once every 2 weeks and we go through a lot of shampoo, conditioner, and detangler. This means that Atwoods is on our regular grocery rotation for doggie grooming products.

As we checked out today with a cart full of shampoo, I had an embarrassing moment when the cashier asked for my digital signature. I spent what felt like 30 seconds looking for the stylus pen that's normally sticking up from the credit card interface, attached with a short cord.  After enjoying a giggle at my expense, the cashier pointed it out to me, saying "don't worry, it happens all the time."

> Don't worry, it happens all the time.

I was apparently not at all the first person to struggle. The pen was not round, made to fit the screen snugly with a low profile, and was &ldquo;well-designed&rdquo; by all aesthetic standards. It looked clean, sleek, and had angles that were attractive to the eye. There was only one problem (well, maybe two):

1. A writing utensil is a familiar piece of everyday life, with defined patterns. Breaking dramatically away from these patterns made the product invisible to a first-time user.
2. I could just have poor observation skills - but the point stands!

It's one thing to design for the eye. But it takes experience and thoughtful consideration to create something beautiful *and* intuitive to use (at least for a well-defined group of people). That also raises the issue of knowing who and what you're designing for. What an amazing hack to produce better work!
