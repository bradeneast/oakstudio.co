[Deno](https://deno.land) is a light weight, feature-rich, secure alternative to NodeJS.

We like Deno here at Oak Studio because it makes blazing fast updates and deploys possible for any of our websites. We can publish a new blog post in less than a minute, without worrying about about installing gigabytes of code to build the site.

Deno offers toolings out of the box that we use to make the code bundles small and fast when you loaded this page. Deno also has well-maintained packages like this [static site generator](https://lumeland.github.io) we use heavily.

## Some more reasons:
- Deno supports Typescript (if you're into that)
- [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/blog/deploy-beta1) is quickly gaining momentum.
- There are over 2500 third-party packages available through Deno, plus most NPM packages through services like [JSPM](https://jspm.org/)

## Summed up
Deno is making web development faster, more performant, and more modern with rapidly increasing momentum. We're on board, and want our clients to reap the benefits!
