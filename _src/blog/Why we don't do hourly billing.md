## Deadlines
Let's face it: everybody has a deadline, and here at Oak Studio, we're really into solving our clients' problems for our clients quickly and efficiently. That's where hourly billing causes some issues. With an hourly model, the longer a project takes, the more we get paid. Instead of being incentivized to complete a project quickly and stay ahead of our clients' deadlines, we have a conflict of interest.

Take this example from Jonathan Stark:

> When a consultant says that he has to bill by the hour in order to prevent his clients from abusing his time, it tells me that he doesn’t trust his clients. Which raises a key question:
>
> Is it reasonable to expect people to trust you if you don’t trust them back?

If there's a situation where deadlines put us on the same side as our clients, we want to create it.

## Summary
At Oak Studio, we aim for building trust, increasing productivity, and putting out higher quality work than last time... without punishing our clients. We feel that hourly billing runs contrary to those values, so we use a more intuitive pricing model.
